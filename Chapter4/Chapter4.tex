\chapter[Measuring the Low Energy Light and Charge Yield of Nuclear Recoils in Liquid Xenon][Measuring the Low Energy Light and Charge Yield of Nuclear Recoils in Liquid Xenon]{Measuring the Low Energy Light and Charge Yield of Nuclear Recoils in Liquid Xenon}
\label{chap:nerix}

%As was discussed in the second and third chapter of this work, understanding the response of liquid xenon to nuclear recoils is very important for the dark matter search as many candidates, including WIMPs, are expected to interact with atomic nuclei.  Liquid xenon detectors continue to grow in size yet this only makes their calibration, specifically with regards to nuclear recoils, increasingly difficult.  

As was discussed in the previous chapters, dual-phase liquid xenon TPCs lead the search for WIMPs.  These detectors continue to grow in size and reduce their background making them increasingly more sensitive to dark matter.  As mentioned in the previous chapter, XENON1T is the largest and most sensitive of these detectors with a total mass of 3,200 kg of liquid xenon \cite{aprile2017first}.  Since WIMPs are expected to interact primarily with atomic nuclei and the differential scattering rate of WIMPs and Standard Model particles are generally expected to increase with decreasing interaction energy, it is crucial to understand the properties of nuclear recoils in LXe down to the few keV energy scale.  

While larger detector sizes (in the form of larger fiducial volumes) make WIMP searches more and more sensitive, they do come with a drawback: calibrations, especially calibrations with external sources, becoming significantly more difficult.   However, understanding the signal output by a LXe TPC can essentially be broken down into two steps: the actual light and charge production and the detector physics.  While the detector physics is unique for each detector used and therefore must be measured for each one, the light and charge production mechanisms are only unique to the medium.  Therefore, if we can effectively decouple the two steps, we can measure the light and charge production mechanism in a detector optimized for calibrations and use it in other detectors.  

As LXe detectors have scaled in size, several of these optimized detectors have been built for exactly this purpose: to measure the light and charge production of liquid xenon to electronic and nuclear recoils.  While each of these detectors was slightly different and designed for a specific purpose, they shared the same relatively simple operating procedure: measure the light and charge produced from an interaction of a known type (electronic or nuclear recoil) and energy.  The neriX (Nuclear and Electronic Recoils in xenon) detector at Columbia University is one of these optimized detectors and has already successfully provided the most precise measurements of the light and charge yield of liquid xenon at multiple electric fields.  In this chapter, we will discuss the measurement of the light and charge yield of low energy nuclear recoils in liquid xenon using the neriX detector at Columbia University.

\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:nerix_expt_setup}

In chapter three, we discussed the nuclear recoil calibration of XENON1T.  In this calibration, an americium-beryllium (AmBe) source was used to irradiate the liquid xenon inside of the detector with MeV energy neutrons.  Simulation is performed to determine the energy spectrum of single scatters in the detectors but, for the most part, the spectrum is defined by the relative cross-section of elastic scatters at different energies ultimately resulting in an exponentially falling energy spectrum as seen in \figref{fig:xe1t_nr_energy_spec}.  In this calibration setup, the energy of each individual event is unknown and at the end of the day are using the entire energy spectrum to match our data.  While this can be an effective way to measure the response of liquid xenon to nuclear recoils, it proves to be very difficult in practice with such a featureless energy spectrum.  This type of measurement where one compares an energy spectrum to data is typically referred to as an \textit{indirect} measurement and has been used successfully to measure the light and charge production process of electronic and nuclear recoils \cite{aprile2013response, akerib2016tritium, aprile2017tritium}.

Measurements in neriX and other smaller, calibration optimized detectors follow a different approach.  A monoenergetic source is used to irradiate the detector where the incoming particle will scatter a single time before scattering into a secondary detector.  For electronic recoils, the secondary detector can be a high-purity germanium detector or sodium-iodide detector with an excellent energy resolution.  When this is the case, assuming the incoming radiation did not scatter with other materials around the detector, the energy of the interaction is known very precisely.  Unfortunately when measuring the response of liquid xenon to nuclear recoils in these detectors, no equivalent secondary detectors exist that will precisely measure the energy of the incoming neutron.  Instead we can use the position of the secondary detector as a proxy for the energy since the energy transferred to a xenon nucleus by a neutron is completely determined by the scattering angle.  This relationship between the energy of the recoiling nucleus and the angle is shown for non-relativistic neutron energies in \eqnref{eqn:nerix_energy_scattering_angle} where $m_n$ is the mass of the neutron, $m_{\textrm{Xe}}$ is the mass of the xenon nucleus, $E_r$ is the energy of the recoiling nucleus, $E_n$ is the energy of the incoming neutron, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle \cite{knoll2010radiation}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nerix_energy_scattering_angle}
        E_r \approx E_n \frac{2 m_n m_{\textrm{Xe}}}{(m_n + m_{\textrm{Xe}})^2}(1 - \textrm{cos} \theta)
\end{equation}

A schematic of the experimental setup for neriX using this \textit{fixed-angle} technique is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_expt_schematic}.  The neutron source in this measurement was a \ce{^2H}$(d, n)$\ce{^3He} generator provided by the Schlumberger Princeton Technology Center which produces 2.45 MeV neutrons at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$.  The secondary detectors used were Eljen Technologies M510 detectors filled with the EJ301 liquid scintillator, chosen for their excellent pulse shape discrimination.

\subsection{neriX Detector}

In this section we will discuss the neriX detector.  neriX was specifically designed to minimize the amount of inactive xenon and materials surrounding the TPC to minimize undetectable energy depositions and with electronics such that it can systematically scan electric fields ranging from approximately 0.15 V/cm to 2.5 kV/cm in the LXe.  These features make neriX an ideal detector for measuring the low-energy response of electronic and nuclear recoils at electric fields relevant to the dark matter search.

For more details on the design and construction of neriX, please refer to chapters four and five of \citeref{goetzke2015low}.

\subsubsection{TPC}

The neriX TPC (shown in \figref{fig:nerix_tpc_labeled}), like XENON1T, was also constructed with PTFE (teflon).  The teflon pieces in neriX are stackable and compressed by stainless steel springs.  The TPC at liquid xenon temperature has an inner diameter of 43 mm.  neriX also included four stainless steel hexagonal meshes and a single field shaping ring to control the electric fields inside of the TPC.  The cathode (used to produce the drift field inside the liquid xenon), the gate (kept at ground near the liquid surface), and the anode (used to extract electrons from the liquid surface and into the gas) were each made of  125 $\mu$m thick wires and 3 mm pitch (distance between parallel wire segments).  A photo of the gate mesh from above is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_tpc_mesh}.  The final mesh was a screening mesh (labeled the ``bottom grid'' in \figref{fig:nerix_tpc_labeled}) used to shield the bottom PMT and was also made a 3 mm pitch but with 25 $\mu$m thick wires (to reduce its surface area).  The field shaping ring is simply a copper coaxial wire embedded in the teflon wall of the TPC 7 mm above the cathode.  The location of the shaping ring was to maximize uniformity of the drift field at an electric field of 1 kV/cm.  The distance between the cathode and the gate mesh, the maximum drift distance of electrons in the TPC, was 23.4 mm.


\begin{figure}[t]

In the left image, one can see the high voltage feedthrough for the anode.  On the right image, one can see the high voltage feedthrough for the cathode and the voltage divider for the field shaping ring.  One can also see the stainless steel pipe used to extract xenon from the inner cryostat's buffer and the plastic tube used to feed re-condensed xenon into the system.}

	\caption{A photo of one of the meshes used in neriX.}
	\label{fig:nerix_tpc_mesh}
\end{figure}



Six PMTs are installed in neriX: a single 2'' Hamamatsu R6041 PMT is installed below the screening mesh, four 1'' multianode Hamamatsu R8520-M4 PMTs are installed above the anode mesh, and a single 1'' Hamamatsu R8520-406 is installed in a light-tight stainless steel enclosure located above the TPC.  This final PMT is coupled to the TPC via a 1 mm fiber optic cable placed in between the four 1'' PMTs and is intended for measuring the decay times of singlet and triplet states in liquid xenon (although this measurement was not performed during the nuclear recoil calibration).  Since almost all light from the scintillation signal in the LXe is reflected at the liquid-gas interface, the bottom PMT is the only PMT used for measuring S1 and S2 signal size for simplicity leaving the top PMTs used for the position reconstruction of an interaction.

The TPC was connected to the cryostat via a stainless steel motion feedthrough that could be used to raise and lower the detector with a precision of $\sim 25 \, \mu$m.  This motion feedthrough could be used to raise and lower the liquid level relative to the TPC since the liquid level was kept constant via the buffer volume discussed in \secref{sec:nerix_cryostat}.

%The neriX TPC in many ways is very similar to the XENON1T TPC.  Both are made of PTFE (teflon), have meshes to produce


\subsubsection{Cryostat}
\label{sec:nerix_cryostat}

The TPC is surrounded by a double-walled vacuum insulated cryostat.  The inner cryostat was custom made for neriX such that the amount of inactive xenon is minimized.  This inner cryostat, shown in \figref{fig:nerix_cryostat_tpc}, left only approximately 1 cm of space between itself and the TPC with the exception of a $\sim 165 \textrm{cm}^3$ buffer volume used to maintain the liquid level and the space left for the high voltage feedthroughs.   The cryostats themselves are only 1.5 mm thick.  To reduce radiative heat transfer, the inner cryostat is blanketed with mylar in the same way as XENON1T.


\begin{figure}[t]

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{nerix_cryostat_tpc}
	\caption{The neriX TPC inside of the cryostat.  Note that excluding the buffer volume (left side of the image) and the space left for the high voltage feedthroughs (right side of the image), very little space is left between the cryostat and the TPC, effectively reducing the amount of inactive xenon for undetectable energy losses.}

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Purification and Cryogenics System}
\label{sec:nerix_cryo_pur}

A diagram of the cryogenics and purification system is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_cryo_pur}.  The cryogenics and purification system used for this measurement is the same as the one used in the measurements of both \citeref{plante2011new} and \citeref{goetzke2016measurement}.

As discussed in earlier chapters, electronegative impurities outgassed from the detector materials will absorb electrons extracted from the interaction site.  Therefore, these impurities must constantly be removed from the xenon to ensure optimal detector operation.  To remove impurities in neriX, the SAES PS4-MT3-R-1 hot getter is used.  Gaseous xenon is flowed through the purification system at approximately 2 SLPM (standard liters per minute) using a KNF N 143 double-diaphragm pump.  A heat exchanger, as described in \citeref{giboni2011xenon}, is used to simultaneously heat up the gaseous xenon coming from the detector and cool down the xenon going towards the detector (from the getter).  This heat exchanger substantially lowers the cooling power required to operate the detector.

To maintain the temperature of the detector, Iwatani PDC08 cold head and SA101 Helium compressor coupled to a copper cold finger are used.  The xenon pressure inside of the cryostat is maintained via resistive heaters thermally connected to the copper cold fingers.  These resistive heaters are controlled by a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller that adjusts the power of the heaters to maintain a desired cold-finger temperature.

	\caption{A schematic of the cryogenics and purification system for neriX.  Also shown are the pressure relief system and the xenon storage system.}
	\label{fig:nerix_cryo_pur}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Pressure Relief System}

Unlike XENON1T, there is no redundant liquid nitrogen cooling in the event of a power loss for neriX.  This means that if there is a power failure at the laboratory that cooling will be lost and the pressure of the detector will climb.  To prevent damage to the system, especially the PMTs, a pressure relief system was built for neriX.  This pressure relief system consists of a 190 liter stainless steel pressure vessel that is connected to the inner cryostat via a solenoid valve that will open in a controlled manner above a certain pressure in parallel with a rupture disk.  The tank size was chosen such that all of the approximately 2.2 kg of xenon could be stored at room temperature at a pressure below 2.5 bar.  The pressure relief vessel was evacuated on a weekly basis to maintain the chemical purity of the xenon in the case of an emergency.


\subsubsection{Xenon Storage}

The xenon for neriX was stored in two cylinders kept inside of a stainless steel dewar.  When filling the detector, a regulator and a needle valve are used in conjunction with a mass flow meter to keep the detector pressure at reasonable levels.  During recuperation, the dewars are filled with liquid nitrogen such that the xenon inside the bottle freezes and the vapor pressure is low enough to create a cryogenic pump from the cryostat to the storage bottles.  While recuperation can be performed more quickly in an emergency situation, both operations could safely be performed in a single day\footnote{Emptying the detector too quickly could lead to the formation of xenon ice which could damage the bottom PMT so care was always taken to maintain a consistent pressure throughout recuperation in non-emergency situations.}.


\subsubsection{Electric Field Strength and Uniformity}

% ensuring <20\% variation in field to define the fiducial volume

Since the goal of neriX is to measure the light and charge yield of nuclear recoils at different electric fields, it is obviously very important to know what electric field you are measuring the yields for and how uniform it is in the detector.  Unlike in XENON1T, the fiducial volume of neriX is not designed to eliminate background but to exclude regions where the field differs drastically from the mean and where charge can be lost to the wall.  To set the fiducial volume and determine the field strength in neriX, the COMSOL Multiphysics\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Suite was used.  

Simulation details can be found in \citeref{goetzke2015low} but we will present the results of the simulation here.  \tabref{tab:nerix_electric_fields} shows the cathode voltages used along with the corresponding fields given an anode voltage of 4.5 kV, a liquid level 2.5 mm above the gate mesh\footnote{The simulations find that the liquid level has a negligible effect though.}, and the bottom mesh and gate mesh kept at ground.  Simulations found that the variation of field could be kept to within 20\% with a radial cut at approximately 20 cm and cuts in depth at 1 mm below the gate mesh and 0.5 mm above the cathode.  For the nuclear recoil calibration, a more conservative radial cut at 18.25 cm was made.

\label{tab:nerix_electric_fields}
\end{table}



\subsubsection{Data Acquisition System and Processing}

Raw PMT signals are amplified and then digitized by three CAEN V1724, 14 bit, 100 MS/s flash ADCs (fADC).  The fADC has a voltage range of 2.25 V, and an input bandwidth of 40 MHz.   Three flash ADCs were required to digitize the 18 PMT signals as well as the multiplexed liquid scintillator signals.  The trigger for the data acquisition system used in this measurement will be discussed in \secref{sec:nerix_coin_trigger} and \secref{sec:nerix_pure_trigger}.

The data processing system, xerawdp, was originally developed for XENON100 \cite{guillaume_thesis} and modified for neriX.  The processing software was used to reduce the raw waveforms into information about the S1, S2, and liquid scintillator signal sizes and timing.  




\subsection{Neutron Generator}

As mentioned in \secref{sec:nerix_expt_setup}, a small \ce{^2H}$(d, n)$\ce{^3He} generator, shown with a ruler for scale in \figref{fig:nerix_minitron_ruler},  is used to produce neutrons.  This generator is provided by the Schlumberger Princeton Technology Center and will be referred to in this work as the minitron.  The tube of the generator is vacuum sealed and deuterium is produced inside by heating up a replenisher filament.  These deuterium atoms are then ionized via electrons produced from a cathode wire that are accelerated by a grid kept at $\sim 200$ volts.  Deuterium ions are then accelerated towards a titanium-deuteride (\ce{TiD_2}) target where they will either collide with a deuterium atom or be completely stopped.  Deuterium ions that are completely stopped actually replenish the target and thus the target is considered self-regenerating\footnote{The thickness of the target is such that all deuterium ions are stopped.}.  A Heinzinger PNC 100000-3 power supply is used to supply up -100 kV of voltage to accelerate the deuterium ions and to read out the deuterium ion beam current.  A schematic of the minitron electronics is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_minitron_schematic}.

Because the minitron neutron generator operates at very high voltage, a protective casing was used to prevent disharges from the high voltage connection. The casing was a stainless steel tube with a diameter of approximately 3 inches and teflon, due to its very large dielectric constant, supporting the minitron and filling in almost all excess space in the stainless steel tube.  The small amount of remaining space was filled with mineral oil, which has a higher dielectric constant than air.

The neutron generator used in this work is the same as used in \citeref{plante2011new}.  For more details on the minitron, please refer to \citeref{guillaume_thesis}.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Neutron Energy Spectrum}

For non-relativistic deuterons,  the energy of the neutron produced from a deuterium-deuterium interaction is only dependent on the scattering angle and the energy of the deuteron.  The exact energy, in this case, is given by \eqnref{eqn:nerix_neutron_energy} \cite{csikai1987crc}. 

\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nerix_neutron_energy}
        abc
\end{equation}

In \eqnref{eqn:nerix_neutron_energy}, $m_{\textrm{He}}$, $m_n$, and $m_d$ are the masses of helium, neutrons, and deuterium, respectively, $Q$ is the $Q$-value of the reaction (3.269 MeV), and $\phi$ is the emission angle of the neutron in the laboratory frame.  To approximate the energy spectrum as a function of the scattering angle and deuteron energy, we say that the yield as a function of these variables is proportional to the differential cross-section multiplied by the distribution of incident deuteron energies, $f(E_d)$\footnote{This derivation of the angular dependence of the neutron energy spectrum is from Qing Lin (current institution: Columbia University)}.  We could assume that this distribution of deuteron energies is a delta function for the fixed target collision but this would ignore all of the other interactions that can occur in the \titde{}.  

\begin{equation}
        \frac{d^2 N}{d E_d d \varphi} \sim \frac{d \sigma}{d \varphi} f(E_d)
\end{equation}

Since the energy of the deuteron is directly related to the energy of the neutron produced by \eqnref{eqn:nerix_neutron_energy}, we can rewrite the above equation in terms of the neutron energy and the emission angle.

\begin{equation}
        \frac{d^2 N}{d E_n d \varphi} \sim \frac{d \sigma}{d \varphi} f(E_d) \left( \frac{\partial E_n}{\partial E_d} \right)^{-1}
\end{equation}

We now define two variables: $\sigma_n$, the total cross-section of deuterium-deuterium fusion into a neutron, and $\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}$, the total cross-section of all possible interactions.  It turns out that $\sigma_{\textrm{tot}} \gg \sigma_n$ due to Rutherford scattering.  Therefore, we say that probability of a neutron being produced per interaction is given by $p = \frac{\sigma_n}{\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}}$.  We say that the number of interactions is approximately given by the energy lost, $E_l$, divided by the average interaction energy, $W$.  We define $W$ in terms of the stopping power such that $W = \frac{dE / dx(E_d) \cdot M}{\sigma_{\textrm{tot}} N_a}$, where $N_a$ is Avogadro's number and $M$ is the molar mass of \titde{}.

Therefore, we approximate the probability that the incoming deuteron, with an energy of $E_{d, m}$, fuses with a deuteron in the target after $i = \frac{E_{d, m}}{W}$ interactions is given by \eqnref{eqn:nerix_minitron_energy_loss_1}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nerix_minitron_energy_loss_1}
        f(E_l) \sim \left( 1 - \frac{\sigma_n}{\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}} \right)^i = \left( 1 - \frac{\sigma_n}{\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}} \right)^{E_l \cdot \frac{\sigma_{\textrm{tot}} N_a}{dE / dx(E_d) \cdot M}}
\end{equation}

This expression for the distribution of the energy lost by the incoming deuteron can be rearranged into a more convenient form.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nerix_minitron_energy_loss_2}
         f(E_l) \sim \left[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\frac{\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}}{\sigma_n}} \right)^{\frac{\sigma_{\textrm{tot}}}{\sigma_n}} \right] ^{E_l \cdot \frac{\sigma_n N_a}{dE / dx(E_d) \cdot M}} \approx e^{-E_l \cdot \frac{\sigma_n N_a}{dE / dx(E_d) \cdot M}}
\end{equation}

With an approximate distribution for the energy loss, and therefore the deuteron energy during the fusion interaction, we can simulate our expected angular distribution \cite{chadwick2011endf, guillaume_thesis}.  The angular distribution assuming a maximum deuteron energy of 80 keV is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_yield_emission_angle}.

\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{nerix_yield_emission_angle}
	\caption{The expected angular distribution of neutrons as a function of emission angle for a maximum deuteron energy of 80 keV.}
	\label{fig:nerix_yield_emission_angle}
\end{figure}





\subsubsection{Neutron Yield}

While ultimately we did not include the neutron rate in our analysis of the yields, we did characterize the neutron generator to ensure that it was operating as expected.  \citeref{guillaume_thesis}, following the analysis from \citeref{csikai1987crc}, shows that the flux of neutrons generated should increase approximately exponentially with the high voltage used to accelerate the ionized deuterium atoms and molecules and linearly with the deuterium ion beam current.  We assume that these two effects are uncorrelated and therefore the neutron production rate can be written as $\frac{dN}{dt} = f(I)g(V)$ where $f(I)$ describes the rate's dependence on the beam current and $g(V)$ describes the rate's dependence on the high voltage.

The neutron flux of the minitron neutron generator was measured using a Nuclear Research Corporation NP-2 portable neutron monitor \cite{np2_manual}.  The NP-2 neutron monitor uses a \ce{BF_3} target to create alpha particles which can then ionize the gas in the detector.  The target is housed inside of a polyethylene moderator with a high hydrogen content to increase the detector's efficiency.  The detector measures in units of dose rate which can be converted to flux by means of the fluence per unit dose equivalent of 2.45 MeV neutrons.  As mentioned, we approximated that the current and high voltage could be treated separately and measured the change in one while holding the other fixed to characterize the neutron flux.  For the measurement, the NP-2 detector was placed 180 cm away from the neutron generator (inside of its case) and at an angle of $\frac{\pi}{2}$.  The rate measurements were then used to fit rate as a function of beam current and voltage (shown in \figref{fig:nerix_minitron_fits}).  Using these functions, we can then predict the neutron flux of the minitron, as shown in \figref{fig:nerix_minitron_rate}.

\subsection{Liquid Scintillators}

In theory, any detector of ionizing radiation could act as the secondary detector in a nuclear recoil calibration.  In practice, however, the gamma ray background rate is large enough in a laboratory setting that detectors with high levels of discrimination are needed to differentiate neutrons from background in the secondary detector.  

For this measurement, the M510 detectors from Eljen Technologies were used.  The M510 detector is filled with the liquid scintillator EJ301, chosen for its excellent pulse shape discrimination properties.  The EJ301 compound has three characteristic decay times: 3.16, 32.3, and 270 ns \cite{kuchnir1968time, ej301_manual}.  The first two states are related to the excitation of electrons to the singlet and triplet state, respectively, while the slowest decay time is from the fluorescence of the triplet states \cite{lang2017improved}.  Nuclear recoils in the liquid scintillator will exhibit much longer decay times than electronic recoils caused by gamma rays.  

An initial characterization of the liquid scintillators was performed to determine the optimal voltage and integration window for nuclear and electronic recoil discrimination and calibrations were performed several times over the course of the run to ensure performance was still adequate.  An example of the pulse discrimination from one the M510 detectors from coincidence data is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_ej_discrimination}.  Similar to \citeref{guillaume_thesis}, we set a threshold in the detectors' pulse size where discrimination is poor - however this was done via the hardware trigger and not a software cut to reduce data intake.

\end{figure}

A fifth and smaller version of the M510 detector was placed 180 cm away from the neutron generator to monitor the minitron rate at all times.



\subsection{Data Acquisition System}
\label{sec:nerix_daq_trigger}

The data acquisition during this measurement is identical to the one described in \citeref{goetzke2016measurement}.  The system consisted of three 14-bit flash ADCs (model v1724 from CAEN) at 100 MS/s with 40 MHz bandwidth.  When a trigger pulse was received by the VME crate controller, this memory would be written to the disk of our data acquisition machine.  The data acquisition server used was synchronized to a storage and processing server where data could be further analyzed.

All of the top signals are fed directly into a Phillips 776 10x amplifiers which are then immediately fed into digitizer channels.  The bottom PMT signal is the only channel used to form the trigger since it sees the majority of the light in the detector.  The bottom PMT's signal is fed into a CAEN voltage divider.  One of these two signals is sent directly to the digitizer unamplified (to avoid digitizer saturation in large S2 signals) while the other copy of the signal is sent to the Phillips 776 10x amplifier where two copies are made.  One of these two copies is sent directly to the digitizer while the other is sent to an updating threshold discriminator.  This updating threshold discriminator produces a NIM pulse for as long as the signal is above the set threshold (5.16 mV for this measurement) making the width in time of the NIM pulse approximately the same as the width of the true signal.  The output from the updating threshold discriminator is considered to be our S1 trigger.  

The S1 trigger is used as the building block for the S2 trigger.  The S1 trigger is sent into a logic fan.  One copy from the logic fan is sent to a variable width gate generator (set at 400 ns for this measurement) while the other is sent into a 24 ns delay.  The gate generator produces a \nimbar{} pulse that is combined in a logical AND with delayed S1 trigger.  In this way, only S1 triggers wider than the gate will cause a new trigger\footnote{The delay is needed because the gate takes approximately 10 ns to create.}.  If the logical AND results in a pulse this is considered an S2 trigger (S2 pulses in general are much wider than S1 pulses).  The width of the S2 trigger pulse is set to be 29.5 $\mu$s for reasons that will be explained shortly.

This S2 trigger is passed into a logical fan where three copies are made.  One is sent into a gate generator that produces a 100 $\mu$s \nimbar{} pulse.  The \nimbar{} pulse is combined with another copy of the S2 trigger in a logical AND thus limiting the maximum rate of triggers to one over the gate width (although typical data acquisition rates are < 100 Hz).

Four M510 detectors were used simultaneously such that two energy spectra could be measured at a time.  Since the rate of signals in the liquid scintillators was low relative to the TPC, it was decided to use a single digitizer channel to capture all of the EJ pulses via multiplexing.  The signals from the PMTs in the M510 detectors were first sent to a Phillips 776 10x amplifier where two amplified copies were produced.  The first copy of the M510 signals was sent into a linear fan.  The second copy of each of amplified M510 signals went to a threshold discriminator.  The threshold was decided on a detector-by-detector basis such that signal sizes were eliminated where we had little discrimination power between nuclear and electronic recoils.  Two copies of the output from the threshold discriminator were created.  The first copy of each signal was sent into a delay generator that delays the logic pulse by a time unique to each detector (for example, one of the M510s' triggers was delayed by 6 $\mu$s while another was delayed by 7 $\mu$s).  The delayed triggers are then sent into the same linear fan as the original pulses.  In this way, the processor can determine which M510 detector the signal came from based on where the M510 trigger is found in the waveform.  

As was mentioned, the threshold discriminator for the M510 detectors creates two copies of each trigger.  The second copy of these triggers is sent into a logical OR to produce a single logic signal.  This logic signal is then delayed 28 $\mu$s and combined in a logical AND with the 29 $\mu$s S2 gate.  The output of the logical AND forms our coincidence trigger.  The long delay and gate may seem unnecessary at first but are actually needed since the M510 signal is very close in time to the S1 and not the S2.  This means that the S2 signal can occur tens of $\mu$s after the M510 trigger is created.  Therefore, by creating a gate on the S2 and delaying the M510 trigger we ensure that we will not lose any good events due to the electron drift time in the TPC.  

A schematic of each of these triggers is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_daq_trigger_setup}.

\section{Characterization and Calibration of neriX}

As mentioned in chapters two and three, the process from energy deposition to the S1 and S2 signal read out of a waveform for analysis can essentially be broken down into two subsections: the signal production and the detector physics.  If we want to measure the physics of the signal production mechanism, we must be able to decouple the detector physics as well as possible.  To do this, we must make independent measurements to characterize the detector as best as we can.  

While many of the properties of the detector we are trying to characterize are the same as XENON1T, there are some differences in how we carry out the measurements simply due to the scale of XENON1T relative to neriX.



\subsection{PMT Characterization}

As in XENON1T, the most basic task in characterizing the TPC is the PMT calibration.  The goal of the PMT calibration is to understand the response of a PMT to incident photons.  This task is typically performed by examining the response of the PMT to a single photoelectron (single electron ejected at the photocathode by incident photon) since larger signals can be estimated via the convolution of multiple single photoelectron response functions.  Ideally, we would like to completely understand the shape of the response function of the PMT but at the same time, most experiments settle for the mean and variance of the response (since by the central limit theorem these will describe the response for large numbers of photons).  However, since we wish to understand the low energy response of nuclear recoils, which will involve very small signals ($< 10$ PE), we cannot settle for knowing only the mean and variance.

As in XENON1T, the low light calibration of PMTs is performed \textit{in situ} using a blue LED pulse generated by digital pulse generator (BNC PB-5) and fed into the detector via a fiber optic cable.  The standard way of calibrating a PMT in this type of experiment is to use a low light level (such that the given PMT only sees a signal 5--10\% of the time) and either fit the data using a Gaussian model of the response or extract the mean and variance according to the statistical treatment in \citeref{saldanha2017model}.  However, neither of these was satisfactory: the former was not satisfactory as it resulted in an unphysical signal for the PMT response approximately 15\% of the time (since the Gaussian distribution is not bounded below by zero) and the latter was not satisfactory given that we are measuring few photoelectron signals and therefore the mean and variance are simply not enough.  Therefore, a new model was developed by the author, called the \textit{cascade model}, which tries to simulate the actual physics of a PMT including the underamplification of electrons and its dynode structure \cite{anthony2017characterization}.  This model is discussed in further detail in \appref{app:pmts} and uses a GPU-based analysis framework, like measurement of the light and charge yield in neriX (the focus of this chapter) and the electronic and nuclear recoil calibration of XENON1T (discussed in \secref{sec:xe1t_er_nr_calibration}), that will be discussed in \appref{app:gpus}.  Unlike the other two calibration methods, it is actually more effective to use a higher light level such that 1--2 photoelectrons are seen on average\footnote{This does not affect the assumption that the number of photoelectrons seen follows a Poisson distribution that is standard in these types of measurements}.  A sample low-light spectrum is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_pmt_best_fit} along with the best fits and 68\% credible regions of both the Gaussian and cascade models.  From this spectrum alone, it does not appear that the cascade model is an improvement but if one looks at \figref{fig:nerix_spe_response}, which shows the full-amplification SPE spectrum for both models, one can see the reason why the Gaussian model is not acceptable: it results in a negative signal a non-negligible fraction of the time.


\begin{figure}[p]

The dotted lines shown are the best fits and the shaded region is the 68\% credible region.}

	\label{fig:nerix_spe_response}
\end{figure}


Unlike \citeref{goetzke2016measurement}, no gain instability was seen during the measurement of the nuclear recoil yields.  

To avoid issues of saturation with the PMTs, nuclear recoil data was taken with PMT gains ranging from $5-10 \cdot 10^5 \, \, e^-$ while electronic recoil data where our concern was the full absorption peak (like the anticorrelation analysis in \secref{sec:nerix_anticorrelation}) was taken with gains two orders of magnitude smaller.  Even using our GPU-based cascade model it is extremely difficult to fit such a small PMT response.  Therefore, we used what is referred to in \citeref{goetzke2015low} as the MPE method.  To use the MPE method you must first calibrate the response of the PMT at its normal operating voltage.  Following a standard calibration, you illuminate the same PMT at the same voltage with a high light level and use the gain found from before to estimate the mean number of photoelectrons.  You then reduce the PMT voltage and remeasure the response of the PMT to the high light level.  Since the mean number of photoelectrons observed should be independent of voltage, you can use the response at the lower voltage and high light level to extract the gain of the PMT at a much lower voltage.

When measuring this effect, we varied the bottom PMT voltage from 800 V, our standard operating voltage, down to 500 V.  At approximately 600 V, saturation effects in the 662 keV peak were no longer present.  Ideally, one would expect the gain to decrease exponentially with voltage, however we noticed a significant deviation from this behavior.  We believe that this deviation is due in part to the decreasing collection efficiency of photoelectrons of the PMT at lower voltages, an effect described in \citeref{carter1980photomultiplier}.  While the voltage dependence of the effect is PMT dependent, we multiplied our power law by a generic second-order polynomial efficiency function in an attempt to describe it.  The best fit of both the gain and collection efficiency are shown in \figref{} and \figref{}


\subsection{Position Reconstruction and Position Dependence}

Position reconstruction also plays an important role in neriX.  While position reconstruction is not used to remove background events, fiducial volumes are still set to avoid edge effects from field non-uniformity and electrons capturing on the teflon.  Additionally, we do expect a small amount of position dependence for both the S1 and S2.  

To determine the transverse position of the event, we again use the S2 signal seen by the top PMTs.  The four PMTs in the top array actually have four individual anodes that are essentially treated as separate channels --- this means that our four multianode PMTs act as sixteen single anode PMT channels.  While obviously our position reconstruction in the transverse position will be significantly more limited due to the small size of the detector (edge effects are more prevalent) and the limited number of pixels, however we can use a neural network trained on an optical simulation of photons produced in between the anode and the gate to estimate the position.  The transverse positions of high-energy ($>40$ PE) neutron events, which should be approximately uniformly distributed in the TPC, at a field of 490 V/cm is shown in the left panel of \figref{fig:nerix_position_reconstruction}.  The small defects in the position reconstruction are likely due to discrepancies in the unmeasured collection efficiencies of the individual PMT channels.

\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{nerix_position_reconstruction}
	\caption{The spatial distributions of high-energy nuclear recoil events taken at 490 V/cm after fiducial volume and other quality cuts.}
	\label{fig:nerix_position_reconstruction}
\end{figure}

To determine the depth of the interaction, we look at the time between the S1 and S2, also referred to as the \textit{drift time}.  Since the electrons will drift through the liquid xenon at a fixed velocity, this time difference can be used to measure the depth.  One would naturally expect the drift velocity in the liquid xenon to change as a function of the electric field applied so this drift velocity must be measured for each field used.

To measure the drift velocity, one uses the fact that the scintillation light produced from interactions in the liquid xenon can actually interact with the meshes, releasing an electron in the process.  These photoionization electrons can be seen following large S1s and S2s in waveforms.  Therefore, if one looks at small S2 signals following a large S1 or S2, one will actually see peaks in the spectra due to these photoionization electrons, as shown in \figref{fig:nerix_drift_velocity}.  By examining the time distance between the two peaks, we can determine the drift velocity since the distance between the meshes at liquid xenon temperatures is 23.4 mm.

\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{nerix_drift_velocity}
	\caption{The distribution of small S2s in the time after a large S2 at a field of 1020 kV/cm.  Notice the two sharply spike peaks around 1.5 and 13 $\mu$s --- these peaks are due to electrons from the photoionization of the gate and cathode mesh.  Since we know the distance between these two meshes we can measure the drift velocity at this field.}
	\label{fig:nerix_drift_velocity}
\end{figure}


The measured drift velocities during this measurement and during the low-energy measurement of the yields of electronic recoils \cite{goetzke2016measurement} are shown in \tabref{tab:nerix_drift_velocities}.  One can see that the drift velocities of all three runs in the detector agree very well with each other (within a few percent).

\label{tab:nerix_drift_velocities}
\end{table}


While due to the small size of the detector we do not observe a radial dependence on the S1 and S2 signals, we do observe effects due to the depth of the interaction in the detector.  The former effect is caused by the proximity of the interaction to the bottom PMT while the latter effect is caused by electrons drifting to the surface attaching to electronegative impurities.  For more details on each of these effects, please refer to \secref{sec:xe1t_lce_pos_correction} and \secref{sec:xe1t_depth_correction}, respectively.  While not as drastic as the effects in XENON1T, these effects are still on the order of 10--20\% for S1s and 5\% for S2s.  To perform the correction, we use events from the 662 keV peak from \cesium{} and fit the S1 and S2 size as a function of depth.  As expected, we observe the same pattern as XENON1T: events closer to the bottom PMT have large S1s than those events closer to the liquid-gas interface and events from lower in the detector are more likely to lose charge to impurities in the liquid xenon.  Both of these effects can be seen in \figref{fig:nerix_pos_correction}.  Due to a getter failure, the purification system utilized a getter much further in distance compared to the one used in \citeref{goetzke2016measurement}, leading to a non-negligible electron lifetime.  Both of these effects were monitored over the course of the run and since no discernable time dependence was seen, a run average was taken.

	\label{fig:nerix_pos_correction}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Single Electron Response}

One very important quantity for TPCs that was discussed in chapters two and three is the single electron response (also known as the gas gain).  The single electron response measures how many photoelectrons we expect in our PMTs if a single electron is extracted from the liquid into the gas.  Typically the response is approximated as a Gaussian distribution with a mean, $\mu_G$, and width, $\sigma_G$.  While technically this quantity could be field-dependent to leakage from the cathode, simulations show that this effect is only on the order of $\sim2\%$ \cite{goetzke2015low}.

We used a source of single electrons already discussed for this calibration: single electrons from the photoionization of the gate.  By using these, we could make a strict time cut rather than search an entire waveform which reduces the potential noise.  Even though only the bottom PMT was used for all analyses, the single electron response was fit in two dimensions for extra discrimination power between single and double electron peaks.  A sample fit is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_gas_gain}.  The response of the TPC to single electron was assumed to be normal for both the top and the bottom PMTs with no correlation.  As in \citeref{aprile2014observation} and \citeref{goetzke2016measurement}, an roll-off was applied at low S2s to represent the loss due to the S2 peak finding efficiency.

\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{nerix_gas_gain}
	\caption{The single electron response as measured by the top and bottom PMTs in neriX.  Note that the response, even for a single electron, appears to follow a Gaussian distribution.  The contours show the outline of the fit and the pink line represents the edge of the fit range.}
	\label{fig:nerix_gas_gain}
\end{figure}

As with the position correction, no clear time dependence was observed for the the single electron response so both the mean and width of the distribution were averaged over the course of the run for all fields.



\subsection{Anticorrelation}
\label{sec:nerix_anticorrelation}

As discussed in \secref{sec:lxe_er_observables} and \secref{sec:xe1t_anticorrelation}, due to the lack of quenching factors in electronic recoils the energy of an interaction and the number of photons and free electrons produced are inextricably linked.  This relationship is shown in \eqnref{eqn:nerix_anticorrelation} where $N_q$ is the number of quanta, $\textrm{E}_{\textrm{ER}}$ is the energy of the electronic recoil, $W$ is the average energy required to produce an exciton or electron-ion pair ($13.7 \pm 0.2$ eV \cite{dahl_thesis}), $N_{\gamma}$ is the number of photons produced in the electronic recoil, and $N_e$ is the number of free electrons extracted from the interaction site.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nerix_anticorrelation}
        N_q = \frac{\textrm{E}_{\textrm{ER}}}{W} = N_{\gamma} + N_{e}
\end{equation} 

In the same way as \secref{sec:xe1t_anticorrelation}, we can put this equation in terms of detector variables including our observables, S1 and S2, the average light collection efficiency, $g_1$, the extraction efficiency, $\eta$, and the mean single electron gain, $G_e$, as shown in \eqnref{eqn:nerix_anticorrelation_s1_s2}.

\begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nerix_anticorrelation_s1_s2}
        \frac{\textrm{E}_{\textrm{ER}}}{W} = \frac{\textrm{S1}}{g_1} + \frac{\textrm{S2}}{G_e \eta}
\end{equation}

This implies that if we have a sample of S1 and S2 signals from a known monoenergetic peak that we can extract the otherwise very difficult to measure quantities $g_1$ and $\eta$.  This type of anticorrelation measurement is typically performed using a single full absorption peak at multiple electric fields (typically done in smaller detectors where the field can be changed easily) or using multiple full absorption peaks from different sources at a single electric field (typically done in larger detectors where electric fields are more difficult to manage and change large amounts).  The latter is done in LUX \cite{akerib2016improved} and XENON1T \cite{aprile2017first}.  For neriX, we decided to vary both to make the measurement as robust as possible: two sources, \cesium{} and \sodium{}, and used to extract monoenergetic events at five different fields.  These events are fit simultaneously to \eqnref{eqn:nerix_anticorrelation_line} where $\textrm{E}_{\textrm{ER}}$ is equal to 662 keV for \cesium{} and 511 keV for \sodium{}.


 \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:nerix_anticorrelation_line}
        \frac{\textrm{S2}}{\textrm{E}_{\textrm{ER}}} = \frac{G_e \eta}{g_1} \frac{\textrm{S1}}{\textrm{E}_{\textrm{ER}}} - \frac{G_e \eta}{W}
\end{equation}

A sample fit is shown in \figref{fig:nerix_anticorrelation}.  No discernable time dependence in the parameters was found and thus a run average was used to describe $g_1$ and $\eta$.

\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{nerix_anticorrelation}
	\caption{Anticorrelation analysis performed on the full absorption peaks \cesium{} and \sodium{} at five different electric fields.  One can also see the best fit of the model shown overlayed.}
	\label{fig:nerix_anticorrelation}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Trigger Efficiency}


As discussed in previous chapters the charge yield of nuclear recoils is significantly lower than an equivalent electronic recoil.  Therefore, it is crucial to estimate the efficiency of the trigger as a function of S2 size.  As discussed in \secref{sec:nerix_daq_trigger}, the S2 trigger is actually based on the width of the event however we will use the total S2 size (area) as a proxy to estimate the efficiency.

The measurement of the trigger efficiency is quite simple.  Rather than using the S2 trigger to record events, as is standard for almost all other TPC calibrations, we use a random trigger and digitize the S2 trigger while irradiating the detector with a \sodium{} source.  In this way, we can check each waveform for an S2 and whether or not an S2 trigger was present.  The random trigger ensures that we in no way bias our measurement of the trigger efficiency by requiring that an S2 be present in the waveform.  While this does eliminate the bias, the measurement is very inefficient in terms of storage since many saved waveforms do not contain relevant data.  While ideally one would measure the S2 trigger efficiency regularly, collecting sufficient statistics took approximately three weeks and therefore regular calibrations were impractical.

Once sufficient statistics were collected, one could use large S2 events to find the standard time difference between the S2 peak and the S2 trigger.  With our trigger system, the time difference between the two was 600--800 ns.  With this time cut in place, we could then look at smaller S2 events and determine whether or not a trigger was present.  The results of the measurement are shown in \figref{fig:nerix_trigger_efficiency}.

\begin{figure}[t]
        \centering
