% Elena
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Elena Aprile.  Not only have you provided support and guidance throughout my time at Columbia but you have given me countless opportunities to learn and grow over my years in the group.  You have been such an inspiration to me and have been a phenomenal mentor.  I will also never forget how you took a chance on me in helping me transfer to Columbia and having me join your group --- I can honestly say that I would not be where I am today without you.


% Luke, Marc, and Guillaume
I would also like to give a special thanks to Luke Goetzke, Marc Weber, and Guillaume Plante for all of their help and guidance during my first few years at Columbia.  You all had seemingly infinite patience and I could not have asked for better teachers and role models.


% Postdocs
I am very thankful to all of the postdoctoral fellows and research scientists who taught, challenged, and mentored me over the course of my Ph.D.  Antonio Jesus Melgarejo Fernandez, Patrick de Perio, Marcello Messina, Qing Lin, and Fei Gao, you all have been an incredible inspiration and I cannot thank you enough for all of your support.  


% Grad Students
I would also like to thank my fellow graduate students Zach Greene, Yun Zhang, Joey Howlett, and Tianyu Zhu.  I have had so much fun working with you all over the years and I have learned so much from all of you and would not have succeeded without you.  


% Marcela
I would also like to give a special thanks to Marcela Stern.  It has been such a pleasure working with you and getting to know you over the years.  You are one of the kindest and most helpful people I know and have made the last few years so enjoyable for me.


% Collaboration
I cannot thank my colleagues in the XENON collaboration enough for their hardwork and dedication that has made our joint effort such a success.  It has been a privilege to be part of such an extraordinary group of people.


% Physics Friends
I would also like to thank my friends Felix Clark, Zach Green, Ryne Carbone, and Russell Smith.  It has been incredible to get to know you all over the last few years.  Through the trial and tribulations of graduate school it was so helpful to always have people to talk to and hang out or grab a beer with.
