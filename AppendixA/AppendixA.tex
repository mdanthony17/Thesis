%The following command starts your chapter. If you want different titles used in your ToC and at the top of the page throughout the chapter, you can specify those values here. Since Columbia doesn't want extra information in the headers and footers, the "Top of Page Title" value won't actually appear.

\label{app:gpus}

In this appendix we will go into more detail about the analysis framework that was briefly mentioned in the previous chapters that was used for the electronic and nuclear recoil calibration.  This framework, proposed and developed by the author for the analysis that will be discussed in the final chapter, enables the use of non-analytical models for parameter estimation in a reasonable time frame.
